# Multivariate Analysis Projects
For Analysis of Multivariate Data we were required to do multiple projects where we focus on one topic for each project.
- For dimensionality reduction we used: Principal Component Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling
- For clustering: K-means and Hierarchical Clustering
- For discriminant analysis: Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis and Multinomial Random Variables
- Finally, for outlier detection: BACON and Mahalanobis Distances
